SUBJECT OUTLINE
43014 Applied   Mechanics and   Design   B
Spring 2024
Subject description
Failure of engineered systems leads to   increase   in costs, downtime   in   manufacturing   and   potentially   even   loss   of   life.   This subject explores some of the many failure   modes associated with   machine   components.   It   enables   students   to   design and analysis frames and machines for stiffness, strength, fatigue   life,   fast   fracture   and   other failure   modes. Specifically, students   perform; external and internal load   analysis   by   applying   principles   of stress,   strain, free   body   diagrams and equilibrium; selection and sizing of materials   and   member   of appropriate   sizes   considering   the   impact   of   failure   modes,   including   Fatigue,   fracture, buckling; referring to relevant   standards   and   codes to   assess   design for   safety; use these theories in conjunction with computational   tools   to   undertake   design   optimisation   and   simulation   for   virtual testing; and undertake experimentation to verify and validate   simulation   and theoretical   results.

Teaching and   learning strategies
This subject consists of three   main teaching   modules and a single   major   project.   Each   module will   be   completed   over   a period of three weeks and formative quizzes undertaken to   gauge   student   competency   of these   modules.   Each   module will comprise of (1) online learning   materials,   (2) weekly face-to-face tutorials,   (3) weekly   forums,   and   (4)   possible lab classes.   Feedback and reflection on   content will   be   provided   during   tutorials where   students   are   required   to actively   participate   in learning activities facilitated by   the   tutor.
Students are expected to complete online learning   materials to   facilitate   in-class   activities   for tutorials   and   forums.   This   will include a number of individual and   collaborative   activities   on   theoretical   and   computational   analysis   where   students   will be encouraged to actively contribute to   collaborative   activities.
Formative Quizzes will be used throughout   learning   modules to   help student   monitor   their   performance   and   provide   feedback on progress and   understanding of content.
A   Mastery exam will be undertaken after week 6   to   demonstrate   student’s   understanding   of the   course   content.
A major project will be undertaken   by   individual   students.   Feedback   will   be   provided   through   direct   engagement   with         tutors where students provided details of their approach to the   projects   and   are given   direction   by   tutors.   This   will   be         assessed through a professional technical report   provided   by the student   and   a   brief   presentation   demonstrating   their   work.

Further                               Detailed   project description will be provided   on   UTSOnline.   information:      For example:
CubeSats Widgets are a variety of small, short lifespan   devices that   are   often   used   for   educational         and short duration scientific   purposes. The Chassis of the Widget   CubeSat   itself is   critical   to   the   life,   protection and   performance of the device.   It   must   protect the   package from loads and   ensure
successful delivery to orbit.
The objective of this   project   is to design the structural frame. of a   CubeSat Widget. the   device   itself   is   exposed to a   number of different events during its operation.   the   launch   and   orbital   process,
including (1) device assembly and transport,   (2)   booster launch,   (3)   high   g   manoeuvring,   and   (4)   thermal cyclic fatigue.Student will   need to develop a series of load cases   based   off their student   number   and   apply   these   to   a specified   package that will be delivered to orbit.   FEA and   design   optimisation   tool   should   be   applied   to minimise weight without degradation of structural performance.
A material sample will   be provided to   the   students   and   they   should   use   mechanical   testing   devices   to   determine material   properties.
Students will be   provided with a material sample and   all   the   necessary   information   to   complete   their   project:
Students should attend a lab session and   undertake   materials   testing   to   determine   main   properties   of   their sample. this will form. the basis of their design task.
A unique load case design will   be developed   as follows   based   on   your   student   number   to   cover   the   main load   case   scenarios.
12345678
12 – maximum g during   manoeuvring
3 – dd = vertex impact from drop,   even   =   edge   impact   from   drop
4 – maximum impact g   (3 x   multiplication   factor)
56 – maximum g   exposure   at   launch
78 – cyclic fatigue   rate   in   RPM
A corner or edge   impact   is   possible during   handling   in the lab. The   chassis   should   be   sufficiently   strong to withstand this   impact.
Thermal expansion occurs with when side panels of the   CubeSat   are   exposed   to   the   sun, where   they   are cyclically heated and cooled through temperature extremes.   This   expansion   and   contraction
develop cyclic   internal stresses   in the structure, leading to fatigue stresses   in   the   chassis   that   can   ultimately lead to failure of the   satellite.
Provided   items will   be (1) side   panels and (2) scientific   package.   Students will   need   to   design   a
simple truss style. chassis and perform   FEA and   design   optimisation to   develop   a   unique   prototype.
